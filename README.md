# MinZX_SDL
A minimal ZX Spectrum emulator, written in C++, using SDL, compiled with Visual Studio.

Using [z80cpp emulator core](https://github.com/jsanchezv/z80cpp) from [José Luis Sánchez](https://github.com/jsanchezv).

Emulator barely working. Working features:

- Boot into Spectrum Basic.
- Can load SNA files from command line.

Missing features:

- No keyboard yet
- No sound yet

As there is no input method yet, only way to test the emulator is to load some game from .SNA which has demo mode, such as Manic Miner.
